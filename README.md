# Computational Linear Algebra Use Cases

In this repo, I'll be showing a few use cases built out using Linear Algebra techniques to solve real world problems in Python projects. 


## Projects

- Number recognition using clustering in Principal Component Analysis





## Number Recognition

In this project I wanted to show an example of how PCA is used to recognize/classify images. To do this, I use a training set of many black and white 20x20 pixel images of hand drawn numbers. Then, I use PCA to map these images to a 2 dimensional plane. By doing this I then use various clustering classification methods to find clusters of points on the 2d grid that map to the same image. Then we test out the PCA & clustering algo to attempt to predict which numbers new pictures represent. In this prohect, I was able to obtain a ~90% accuracy rating. Below is an example of a few images mapped onto a 2d plane.
